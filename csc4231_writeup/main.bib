Abstract = {{A moment estimator of theta, the coancestry coefficient for alleles
   within a population, was described by Weir \& Cockerham in 1984 (100)
   and is still widely cited. The estimate is used by population
   geneticists to characterize population structure, by ecologists to
   estimate migration rates, by animal breeders to describe genetic
   variation, and by forensic scientists to quantify the strength of
   matching DNA profiles. This review extends the work of Weir \& Cockerham
   by allowing different levels of coancestry for different populations,
   and by allowing non-zero coancestries between pairs of populations. All
   estimates are relative to the average value of theta between pairs of
   populations. Moment estimates for within- and between-population theta
   values are likely to have large sampling variances, although these may
   be reduced by combining information over loci. Variances also decrease
   with the numbers of alleles at a locus, and with the numbers of
   populations sampled. This review also extends the work of Weir \&
   Cockerham by employing maximum likelihood methods under the assumption
   that allele frequencies follow the normal distribution over populations.
   For the case of equal theta values within populations and zero theta
   values between populations, the maximum likelihood estimate is the same
   as that given by Robertson \& Hill in 1984 (70). The review concludes by
   relating functions of theta values to times of population divergence
   under a pure drift model.}},

abstract ={Motivation: The computational identification of non-coding RNA regions on the genome is currently receiving much attention. However, it is essentially harder than gene-finding problems for protein-coding regions because non-coding RNA sequences do not have strong statistical signals. Since comparative sequence analysis is effective for non-coding RNA detection, efficient computational methods are expected for structural alignment of RNA sequences. Several methods have been proposed to accomplish the structural alignment tasks for RNA sequences, and we found that one of the most important points is to estimate an accurate score matrix for calculating structural alignments.Results: We propose a novel approach for RNA structural alignment based on conditional random fields (CRFs). Our approach has some specific features compared with previous methods in the sense that the parameters for structural alignment are estimated such that the model can most probably discriminate between correct alignments and incorrect alignments, and has the generalization ability so that a satisfiable score matrix can be obtained even with a small number of sample data without overfitting. Experimental results clearly show that the parameter estimation with CRFs can outperform all the other existing methods for structural alignments of RNA sequences. Furthermore, structural alignment search based on CRFs is more accurate for predicting non-coding RNA regions than the other scoring methods. These experimental results strongly support our discriminative method employing CRFs to estimate the score matrix parameters.Availability: The program which is implemented in C++ is available at http://phmmts.dna.bio.keio.ac.jp/ under the GNU public license.Contact: satoken@bio.keio.ac.jp},

The methods we describe in this paper, implemented in the CRAIG program, allow researchers to modularly specify and train sequence analysis models that combine a wide range of weakly informative features into globally optimal predictions. Our results for the gene prediction problem show significant improvements over existing ab initio gene predictors on a variety of tests, including the specially challenging ENCODE regions. Such improved predictions, particularly on initial and single exons, could benefit researchers who are seeking more accurate means of recognizing such important features as signal peptides and regulatory regions. More generally, we believe that our method, by combining the structure-describing capabilities of HMMs with the accuracy of margin-based classification methods, provides a general tool for statistical learning in biological sequences that will replace HMMs in any sequence modeling task for which there is annotated training data.</p></sec>},
